# An introduction to WebGPU compute shaders

 This is the code from [Unleash Your Inner Supercomputer: Your Guide to WebGPU Compute](https://www.vizitsolutions.com/portfolio/webgpu/compute/).
 We discuss concepts underlying mapping problems onto the GPU, and why it produces significant performance improvements. We develop a couple of
 simple examples to illustrate the basic ideas, then proceed on to step by step development of a finite difference treatment of the time evolution
 of the Schrödinger equation. We include issues such as the accuracy of floating point representations, numerical instability, performance tuning,
 interactivity, and verification of correctness.

 I am particularly interested in encouraging these techniques to provide examples for instructional design and education in physics and computer
 science. For example, these techniques can be extended to include interactive simulations of the heat equation, fluid dynamics, and for the
 adventurous, electromagnetic fields.
 
 The earlier [WebGL based version](https://github.com/VizIT/gpgpu-Schrodinger/tree/v1.1.0) is available, as is the
 [documentation](https://www.vizitsolutions.com/portfolio/webgl/gpgpu/).
